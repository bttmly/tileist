# Tileist

Generate something like this http://dev.ghost.org/content/images/2013/Nov/user_cover.png out of some settings, a color, JavaScript

## To do

### Shape rendering
- Implement rendering of rectangular or hexagonal tiles
- Allow left-to-right triangles, or right-to-left
- Equilateral triangles?

### Color manipulation
- Fix color manip function params to avoid particular "darkening" or "gray-ing" of certain colors. (No idea how to approach that right now)
- Reduce randomness slightly so colors close to focus are clearly lighter, and vice versa.


### Beyond
- Consider moving from jQuery to Snap.svg
